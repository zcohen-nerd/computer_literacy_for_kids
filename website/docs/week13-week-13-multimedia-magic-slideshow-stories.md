# Week 13: Multimedia Magic - Slideshow Stories

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 13 LOs and Activities.

  - Choose presentation software ([<u>Canva</u>](https://www.canva.com/), PowerPoint, [<u>Google Slides</u>](https://docs.google.com/presentation/)) and ensure access/login. Familiarize with new slide, text, image insert, basic transitions/animations, presentation mode.

  - Have typing practice site ready.

  - Prepare/print visual instruction card.

  - Set up visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* If presentation software is intuitive, explore more formatting options (fonts, colors, shapes). If challenging, stick to basic text/image insertion on simple layouts.

  - *Final Project Link:* "Learning to make slideshows is great practice! You could use this tool to tell your final 'Digital Creation Story' with pictures and words, arranging the slides like pages in a book."

  - *Storytelling Prompt:* Encourage thinking about the *order* of slides to tell a simple story or present facts logically about a topic of interest.

- **Guided Session 1: Presentation Power**

  - **LO:** Identify presentation software purpose (slideshows); navigate chosen tool; create new slides; add/type text; insert images (upload/search); resize/reposition elements; save/name presentation.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Introduce Presentations:** Explain slideshows = digital show-and-tell for stories/facts with pictures.

    2.  **Tool Tour:** Open chosen tool (e.g., [<u>Google Slides</u>](https://docs.google.com/presentation/)). Show slide area, thumbnails, toolbar (New Slide, Text Box, Insert Image).

    3.  **Create Title Slide:** Use first slide. Click text boxes, add title (e.g., "All About Dinosaurs", "My Fantasy World") and "By \[Child's Name\]".

    4.  **Add New Slide:** Click 'New Slide' (+). Choose layout ('Title and Content').

    5.  **Add Text & Image:** New slide: title (e.g., "T-Rex"). Type fact ("T-Rex was a large carnivore."). Insert Image (upload saved pic or supervised web search). Resize/position image & text box.

    6.  **Save:** Show Save command (PowerPoint) or name file & explain auto-save (Google Slides/Canva). Name "My First Slideshow".

    7.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What are slideshows good for?" "How do you add a picture to a slide?"

- **Guided Session 2: Making Slides Shine**

  - **LO:** Add slides with different layouts; apply simple slide transitions; apply simple entrance animations (optional); enter/navigate presentation mode.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Add More Content & Layouts:** Add 1-2 more slides about different aspects of their interest (e.g., another dinosaur, a different character). Explore different layout options ('Two Content', 'Title Only'). Practice adding text/images.

    2.  **Transitions:** Find 'Transitions' menu. Select slide thumbnail. Choose simple effect ('Fade', 'Slide'). Apply to few slides or 'Apply to all'. Explain transitions = how *slides* change.

    3.  **Animations (Optional):** Select item *on* slide (text box/image). Find 'Animations' menu. Apply simple entrance ('Appear', 'Fade In'). Apply to 1-2 items only. Explain animations = how *items on slide* appear. Caution against overuse.

    4.  **Presentation Mode:** Find 'Present'/'Slideshow' button. Click for full screen. Show how to advance (click, spacebar, right arrow). Practice presenting the few slides. Press 'Esc' to exit.

    5.  **Save/Check Auto-Save:** Ensure work saved.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What's the difference between a transition and an animation?" "How do you see your slideshow full screen?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "My Mini-Show"**

  - **Instruction:** "Add to our slideshow! Open 'My First Slideshow'. Add one new slide about your *most* favorite topic related to our theme (dinosaur, character, planet, etc.). Choose a layout, find a good picture (use Kiddle first to find one, save it, then insert it), and write one interesting sentence. Try adding a transition to this new slide!"

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Presentation software basics (adding slides, layouts, text, images, transitions), finding/saving/inserting images.

  - **Setup:** Access to presentation file, Kiddle access (optional), visual timer.
