# 18-Week Computer Literacy Curriculum

This curriculum provides a detailed, step-by-step guide for integrating guided learning with independent creative practice to build computer literacy skills for a young beginner (target age ~7), tailored to the child's individual interests (e.g., dinosaurs, space, animals, fantasy, vehicles, art, music). It begins with a strong foundation in online safety and digital citizenship, incorporating the Be Internet Awesome curriculum and optional 3D printing concepts. This version includes notes on adaptability, enhanced creative storytelling, earlier connection to the final project, and reflective moments.

**Curriculum Overview:**

- **Target Audience:** Young beginner computer users (around age 7), assumes basic reading ability. Adult guidance is essential.

- **Sessions:** Two 30-minute guided sessions + one 20-minute independent session per week.

- **Typing Practice:** Integrate 5-10 minutes of touch typing ([TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/) / [BBC Dance Mat Typing](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zf2f9j6/articles/z3c6tfr)) into one or both *guided* sessions most weeks, starting Week 4.

- **Final Project:** A culminating "Digital Creation Story" project combining multiple skills learned (Weeks 17-18), themed around the child's interests. Introduced conceptually around Week 4/5 and referenced periodically.

- **Be Internet Awesome Theme:** "When in Doubt, Talk It Out" - This crucial message will be introduced in Week 1 and reinforced throughout discussions involving online interactions.

- **Flexibility & Adaptability:** This plan is a guide, not a rigid script. **Observe the child's engagement, interest, and pace.** If they grasp concepts quickly, feel free to introduce optional challenges or move slightly faster. If they need more time on a topic, allow for it, perhaps simplifying the next activity or spending an extra session. The goal is confident understanding and enjoyment, not just completing the checklist. Adapt activity themes (drawings, stories, searches) to match the child's current passions.

*(Note: Software like Paint 3D, Notepad, WordPad, File Explorer, and often Microsoft Clipchamp are typically built into Windows 11 and don't require separate installation. Alternatives like Google Docs/Slides/Sheets, Canva, Scratch, Tinkercad are web-based and free but may require account creation.)*

If searching is easy, try slightly more complex search terms (e.g., "what did stegosaurus eat"). If comparing sites is hard, focus just on identifying known sources vs. unknown ones.
:::

:::info Final Project Link
We're learning how to find information online. Later, when we do our big "Digital Creation Story" project, you might need to look up facts about your chosen topic, so this skill will be super helpful.
:::

- **Guided Session 1: Web Browser Voyage & Safe Sites**

  - **LO:** Use browser (address bar, back/forward, refresh); navigate safe sites; use kid-friendly search engine ([Kiddle](https://www.kiddle.co/)); perform simple keyword searches; begin typing practice.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Browser Tour:** Open browser. Point out address bar, back/forward, refresh. Explain functions.

  2.  **Visit Safe Sites:** Visit pre-selected safe sites relevant to interests (e.g., [NASA Kids' Club](https://www.nasa.gov/kidsclub/), [Nat Geo Kids](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/), museum kids' pages). Discuss why they are safe/good (trusted names, educational).

  3.  **Introduce Kiddle:** Go to [Kiddle](https://www.kiddle.co/). Explain it's a safer search engine for kids.

    4.  **Practice Searching:** Help pick keywords for interests (e.g., "T-Rex facts," "how rockets work," "pictures of puppies"). Type into Kiddle. Look at image/web results.

  5.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Start first lesson on [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/) or [BBC Dance Mat](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zf2f9j6/articles/z3c6tfr). Focus on posture, home row.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What does the address bar show?" "Why might we use Kiddle instead of a regular search engine sometimes?"

- **Guided Session 2: Thinking About Search Results**

  - **LO:** Understand search results link to different sites; identify simple trustworthiness clues (known source, appearance); compare info from two sources; reinforce asking adult if unsure.

  - **Activity:**

  1.  **Review Search:** Perform search on [Kiddle](https://www.kiddle.co/) (e.g., "how fast can cheetah run?"). Explain each link = different website.

    2.  **Evaluate Links (Simple):** Look at top results. Ask: "Know this website name?" (e.g., Nat Geo Kids vs. random name). "Description helpful?" Click 1-2 links. Ask: "Easy to read? For kids or grown-ups? Lots of ads?"

    3.  **Compare Information:** Find simple fact (e.g., cheetah speed, number of legs on insect) on two different kid-friendly sites via Kiddle. Ask: "Do they match?" Discuss reliability.

    4.  **Reinforce "Talk It Out":** Remind: "If website looks strange, confusing, asks for info, what do you do?" (Tell a grown-up!).

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "How can you guess if a website might be good before clicking?" "Why look at more than one website?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Fact Collector"**

  - **Instruction:** "Be an info detective! Use [Kiddle](https://www.kiddle.co/) to find one interesting fact about a topic you like (e.g., dinosaurs, planets, a favorite animal). Write the fact (or draw a picture about it) in Notepad/Paint 3D or just be ready to tell me."

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Using kid-safe search engine, formulating queries, extracting information.

  - **Setup:** Visual instruction card with Kiddle link, Notepad/Paint 3D (optional), visual timer.

## Week 5: Code Sparks - Hello Scratch!

  - Refresh understanding of Scratch interface & basic Motion/Looks/Events/Control blocks.

  - Have the typing practice site ready.

  - Prepare/print visual instruction card.

  - Set up visual timer.

:::tip Flexibility
If block coding is intuitive, challenge them to combine more blocks or explore Sounds early. If confusing, stick to simple 1-2 block scripts and repeat clicking them.
:::

:::info Final Project Link
We're starting to learn Scratch! This is a tool we could use to make parts of the final "Digital Creation Story" move, like making characters walk or objects fly.
:::

- **Guided Session 1: Cracking the Code**

  - **LO:** Define coding (instructions); navigate Scratch interface (Sprite, Stage, Blocks); understand block categories by color; drag/drop blocks; use basic Motion blocks (move, turn).

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Intro to Coding:** Explain coding = recipe/instructions for computer; blocks = ingredients/steps. Show simple recipe vs. Scratch script.

  2.  **Scratch Interface Tour:** Log in to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), click 'Create'. Point out Stage (action area), Sprite (character), Block Palette (block menu), Scripting Area (building space).

    3.  **Explore Blocks:** Click different categories (Motion-Blue, Looks-Purple, Sound-Pink, Events-Yellow, Control-Orange) to show variety. Explain colors group similar actions.

    4.  **First Script:** Drag move 10 steps (Motion) to scripting area. Click block -\> Sprite moves. Drag turn 15 degrees. Click block -\> Sprite turns.

    5.  **Experiment:** Let the child drag out & click a few different Motion blocks (e.g., go to random position, glide) to see effects.

    6.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons. Focus on home row.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What does the 'Motion' block category help the sprite do?" "What happens when you click a block in the scripting area?"

- **Guided Session 2: Making Sprites Move & Talk**

  - **LO:** Understand Event blocks (when green flag clicked); connect blocks into scripts; use Looks blocks (say, think, next costume); use Control blocks (wait).

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Starting Scripts:** Introduce 'Events' (yellow). Drag out when green flag clicked. Explain this is the "Go!" button for the script attached below it.

    2.  **Connect Blocks:** Snap move 10 steps under the event block. Click green flag icon above stage -\> Sprite moves. Snap turn 15 degrees below move block. Click flag again. Show how blocks run in order.

    3.  **Looks Blocks:** Go to 'Looks' (purple). Add say Hello! for 2 secs. Click flag. Click inside "Hello!" and change text (e.g., "Let's explore!"). Try think Hmmm... for 2 secs. Add next costume block (if sprite has multiple costumes) - click flag repeatedly to see it change appearance.

    4.  **Wait Block:** Go to 'Control' (orange). Add a wait 1 secs block between actions (e.g., move, wait, say, wait, next costume). Click flag, observe the pauses making actions distinct.

    5.  **Save Project:** Click 'File' -\> 'Save now'. Guide the child to click the title box (default "Untitled") above the stage and type a name like "My First Animation". Explain Scratch saves online when logged in.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What does the green flag block do?" "How does the 'wait' block change how the script runs?" "What kind of things can 'Looks' blocks do?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Sprite Explorer"**

  - **Instruction:** "Open your Scratch project (or start a new one). Can you make your sprite do something new when the green flag is clicked? Try adding a block from the 'Sound' category (like 'start sound Meow'), or maybe use a 'Looks' block you haven't tried yet (like 'change color effect'). Experiment and see what happens! Remember to save your changes."

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Scratch interface navigation, experimenting with different block categories (Sound, Looks), building simple scripts, saving work.

  - **Setup:** Access to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) (logged in), visual timer.

## Week 6: Scratch Stories & Loopy Logic

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 6 LOs and Activities.

  - Ensure login access to Scratch.

  - Familiarize yourself with adding backdrops, adding sprites from library, the forever and repeat loops, adding/playing sounds, and the difference between touching condition and broadcast/receive events in Scratch.

  - Have the typing practice site ready.

  - Prepare/print the visual instruction card for the independent session.

  - Set up the visual timer.

:::tip Flexibility
If loops are confusing, focus on repeat first with small numbers. If interaction is tricky, stick to one method (e.g., just touching) rather than introducing both.
:::

  - *Storytelling Prompt:* Encourage naming sprites meaningfully and choosing backdrops/sounds that fit a simple story idea (e.g., "Let's make the dinosaur roar when the explorer gets close!").

- **Guided Session 1: Setting the Scene**

  - **LO:** Choose and add a backdrop from the Scratch library; add a new sprite from the library; position sprites on the stage; implement simple interaction between two sprites using either if touching or broadcast/receive.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Add Backdrop:** Open Scratch project. Click 'Choose a Backdrop' (bottom right). Browse library (e.g., 'Fantasy', 'Outdoors') and select one.

    2.  **Add Sprite:** Click 'Choose a Sprite' (cat icon). Browse library (e.g., 'Animals', 'People') and select a second sprite.

    3.  **Position Sprites:** Click and drag sprites on stage. Show selecting which sprite to code by clicking its icon below stage.

    4.  **Interaction Option 1 (Touching):**

        - Select Sprite 1. Build script: when green flag clicked -\> forever (Control) -\> if \<touching \[Sprite 2 v\]?\> then (Sensing inside Control if).

        - Inside if, drag say Ouch! for 1 secs (Looks).

        - Select Sprite 2. Add movement: when green flag clicked -\> move 10 steps.

        - Run (green flag). Drag Sprite 2 to touch Sprite 1; observe reaction. Stop script.

    5.  **Interaction Option 2 (Broadcast - Alternative):**

        - Select Sprite 1. Script: when green flag clicked -\> move 50 steps -\> wait 1 secs -\> broadcast \[message1 v\] (Events). Click 'New message', name it "greeting", click OK.

        - Select Sprite 2. Script: when I receive \[greeting v\] (Events) -\> say Hello back! for 2 secs (Looks).

        - Run (green flag). Observe sequence. Explain broadcast = secret signal.

    6.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "How did we make the sprites interact?" "What does broadcast/receive do?" or "What does the 'touching' block check for?"

- **Guided Session 2: Repeat That! Loops & Sounds**

  - **LO:** Understand and use forever loop for continuous action; use repeat \[ \] loop for fixed repetitions; add sounds from Scratch library; use sound blocks (play sound until done, start sound); use when this sprite clicked event.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Forever Loop:** Select sprite. Script: when green flag clicked -\> forever -\> (Inside) move 10 steps -\> if on edge, bounce (Motion). Click flag -\> continuous movement. Click red stop sign. Explain forever = keep doing until stopped.

    2.  **Repeat Loop:** Script: when green flag clicked -\> repeat \[4\] (Control) -\> (Inside) turn right 90 degrees (Motion) -\> wait 0.5 secs (Control). Click flag -\> turns square. Change '4' to '10', '90' to '36'. Click flag -\> slow spin. Explain repeat = fixed number of times.

    3.  **Add Sounds:** Select sprite. Click 'Sounds' tab. Click 'Choose a Sound'. Browse library (e.g., 'Effects', 'Loops'), pick sound. Sound added to list.

    4.  **Play Sounds in Script:** Back to 'Code' tab. Drag play sound \[sound v\] until done (Sound) into script. Try start sound \[sound v\] – discuss difference (waits vs. continues).

    5.  **Click Event:** Try script: when this sprite clicked (Events) -\> start sound \[sound v\] (Sound). Click sprite on stage -\> plays sound.

    6.  **Save Project:** File -\> Save now. Name "Loops and Sounds".

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What's the difference between 'forever' and 'repeat'?" "How do you add a sound to your sprite?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Scratch Story Scene"**

  - **Instruction:** "Build a mini-scene with action! Start new Scratch project. Choose backdrop & at least one sprite. Make sprite move or spin using a loop when green flag clicked. Bonus: Add sound effect when sprite moves or when you click it! Save project."

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Scratch basics (sprites, backdrops, motion, looks, sound, events, loops).

  - **Setup:** [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) access, visual timer.

    2.  **Snap Grid:** Point out 'Snap Grid' (bottom right). Change 1.0mm -\> 0.1mm -\> drag shape slowly (finer movement). Change back to 1.0mm. Explain use cases (big steps vs tiny adjustments).

    3.  **Change Color:** Select object/shape. Click solid color circle (Inspector window). Choose new color. Explain visualization purpose. Show 'Multicolor' option for groups if applicable.

    4.  **Inspect Views:** Use View Cube (top left) systematically. Click 'Top', 'Front', 'Left'. Ask: "Is it aligned? Right height?" Use orbit (right-drag) for corners. Click 'Home' icon. Emphasize checking all angles for building accurately.

    5.  **Refine Design:** Use tools (Ruler, Snap Grid, Colors, Views) to refine previous object or start new simple design needing precision (e.g., box with lid, ensuring lid dimensions roughly match box opening).

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "How does the Ruler tool help make things exact?" "Why is it important to look at your design from different sides when building?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "My Own Creation"**

  - **Instruction:** "Keep creating in 3D! Go into [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/). Either improve the design from our lesson (maybe use the Ruler to make it an exact size, add more detail, change color), OR start something new! Try designing a character from your favorite game, a cool pattern using shapes, or a futuristic vehicle. Remember to use the view controls!"

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Tinkercad skills (grouping, holes, color, text, ruler, snap grid, view controls), creative design, precision adjustments.

  - Have your specific slicer software ([Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/), [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/), etc.) installed and configured for your 3D printer. Refresh understanding of loading STL, basic manipulation, slicing, previewing.

  - Ensure the 3D printer is operational (filament loaded, bed clear, level). Choose a quick-printing, simple STL beforehand as a backup.

  - Have the typing practice site ready.

  - Prepare/print the visual instruction card for the independent session.

  - Set up the visual timer.

:::tip Flexibility
Spend more time browsing models if the child enjoys it. If slicer software seems too complex, focus on the concepts (slicing like bread) and just demonstrate the preview, handling most operations yourself initially. The goal is understanding the process, not mastering the slicer yet.
:::

  - *Safety Note:* Emphasize that 3D printers have hot parts and moving components and must only be operated with close adult supervision.

- **Guided Session 1: Finding Fantastic Prints**

  - **LO:** Navigate model websites ([Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/), [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/)); search for models; understand STL files; assess basic printability; download simple STL file.

  1.  **Explore Model Sites:** Open [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/). Explain as online library for 3D models shared by people for printing. Browse main page.

    2.  **Search for Models:** Use search bar for interests (e.g., "dinosaur," "car," "castle," "animal"). Browse results together.

    3.  **Analyze Models:** Click interesting models. Look at pictures. Read description briefly. Ask: "Look easy/hard to print?" Point out overhangs/thin parts. Aim for simple/solid first print.

    4.  **Download STL:** Select simple model. Find download button/Files tab. Download ".stl" file. Note save location ('Downloads'). Explain STL = shape recipe.

    5.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What kind of file do we download for 3D printing?" "What makes a model look 'easy' to print?"

- **Guided Session 2: Slicing & Printing Magic!**

  - **LO:** Understand slicer purpose (STL -\> G-code layers); Open STL in slicer; Use basic move/scale/rotate; Initiate 'Slice' with defaults; Use preview function; (Supervised) Start small 3D print.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Introduce Slicer:** Open your slicer (Cura/PrusaSlicer). Explain: "This software takes the STL shape, slices it into thin layers (like bread), figures out the nozzle path for each layer, and saves instructions (G-code) our printer understands."

    2.  **Load STL:** Use 'Open File'/'Import' to load downloaded STL. Model appears on virtual bed.

    3.  **Basic Manipulation:** Show tools: Move (center model), Scale (resize if needed), Rotate (place flattest side down).

    4.  **Slice & Preview:** Select basic settings (PLA material, 0.2mm layer). Click 'Slice'. Wait. Find 'Preview'/'Layer View'. Use slider to move through layers, showing build process. Point out nozzle path lines.

    5.  **Start Print (Supervised):**

        - Save G-code: Click 'Save/Export G-code'. Save to printer's SD card/send via network.

        - Prepare Printer: **Adult supervision crucial.** Ensure bed clean, filament loaded. Explain printer parts briefly (bed, nozzle, filament). Emphasize **hot parts** and moving pieces - **do not touch** while running.

        - Load & Print: Insert SD card/select file on printer. Start print *together*.

        - Watch First Layers: Watch first layers adhere. Explain slow process, needs supervision. Reiterate safety.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What does the slicer software do to the 3D model?" "What did the layer preview show us?" "What's an important safety rule around the 3D printer?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Printable Wishlist"**

  - **Instruction:** "Dream about future prints! Go back to [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/) or [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/). Search for things you like (dinosaurs, cars, characters, useful things). Find three cool models you might like to print someday. Open Notepad (built-in). Try to copy the web address (link) for each model and paste it into Notepad, or just write down their names."

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Website navigation, searching, identifying desired items, copy/paste (optional practice), saving info in text file.

  - **Setup:** Access to model websites, Notepad, visual timer.

## Week 11: AI Adventures & Smart Sparks

:::

:::info Final Project Link
AI like ChatGPT can sometimes help us brainstorm ideas for stories, like our final project. But remember, we always need to check any facts it gives us.
:::

- **Guided Session 1: Meeting the AI Helper**

  - **LO:** Define AI simply (pattern-learning program); interact safely with chatbot ([ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)) under supervision; understand AI is tool, not person; reiterate no sharing private info.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Introduce AI:** Explain AI = smart computer program learned from reading lots online. Good at language patterns. Can answer/write like human, but doesn't 'think' or 'feel'.

  2.  **Supervised ChatGPT Interaction:** Log in to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). Explain you type prompts first. Use fun prompts based on child's interests:

        - "Tell short funny story: dinosaur learns to fly."

        - "3 interesting facts about \[Favorite Animal\]?"

        - "Write haiku about \[Favorite Vehicle/Place\]."

    3.  **Discuss Responses:** Read answers together. Ask: "Make sense? Interesting? Sound human? Where info from?" (Learned from text).

    4.  **Safety Reminder:** State clearly: "ChatGPT is computer program. Never tell it secrets (full name, address, passwords, private feelings)." Reinforce: **"When in Doubt, Talk It Out!"**

    5.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "Is ChatGPT a person or a computer program?" "What kind of information should we *never* share with it?"

- **Guided Session 2: Creative & Critical AI Use**

  - **LO:** Use AI for creative brainstorming; understand AI can be wrong ("hallucinate"); practice verifying AI facts with trusted source; know to ask adult if AI response is weird/wrong.

  - **Activity:**

  1.  **AI for Ideas:** Use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) for brainstorming (supervised typing):

        - "5 story ideas: magical creature goes to school."

        - "Cool names for a superhero whose power is super speed."

        - "Describe what imaginary underwater city might look like."  
          Discuss ideas. Explain AI helps spark creativity.

    2.  **Check the Facts:** Ask ChatGPT fact question (e.g., "What is the biggest dinosaur?"). Then verify answer on trusted site (e.g., museum website, Nat Geo Kids). Compare. Explain AI often right, but double-checking important facts is crucial.

    3.  **Discuss "Hallucinations":** Explain simply: "Sometimes AI guesses or makes things up if unsure. Scientists call this 'hallucination'. That's why we check facts."

    4.  **Reinforce "Talk It Out":** Ask: "What if AI says something weird, wrong, or uncomfortable?" (Stop, tell grown-up!).

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "How can AI help us be creative?" "Why is it important to check facts the AI gives us?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "AI Idea Spark"**

  - **Instruction:** "Let's use AI for drawing ideas! Think of a question about your interests (like 'What does a friendly robot dog look like?' or 'Describe a castle made of clouds'). With my help typing into [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), we'll ask. After reading answer, open Paint 3D & draw picture based on AI's idea!" (Requires parent initiation/supervision of AI).

  - Have Paint 3D or Canva ready for independent session.

  - Have typing practice site ready.

  - Prepare/print visual instruction card.

  - Set up visual timer.

:::tip Flexibility
Spend more time on the Interland game the child enjoys most or the concept they need more reinforcement on (Kindness, Sharing, Passwords). Keep role-playing simple and focused on positive actions.
:::

- **Guided Session 1: Be Internet Awesome - Kind & Careful!**

  - **LO:** Define/discuss online kindness ("It's Cool to Be Kind"); positive vs. negative behavior; appropriate actions for unkindness (Tell adult, block); think before sharing ("Share with Care"); review private/public info; simple digital footprint concept.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Discuss Kindness:** Ask: "How be kind online?" (Nice words, help). Discuss why unkindness hurts. Use BIA slogan: "It's Cool to Be Kind."

  2.  **Play Kind Kingdom:** Play [**Google Interland: Kind Kingdom**](https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/interland/kind-kingdom). Discuss scenarios (spread kindness, block negativity).

    3.  **Role-Play:** Scenario: "Mean comment on your drawing?" Discuss options: Don't reply meanly, tell adult, block (explain simply). Emphasize telling adult.

    4.  **Share with Care Review:** Review private vs. public info (Week 1). Ask: "Why keep address secret?" Use BIA slogan "Share with Care." Explain: "Think who you share with."

    5.  **Digital Footprint Intro:** Explain simply: "Online actions leave 'footprints'. They can last long time. Leave kind & careful footprints!"

  6.  **Play Mindful Mountain:** Play [**Google Interland: Mindful Mountain**](https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/interland/mindful-mountain). Discuss sharing info only with right people.

    7.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

- **Guided Session 2: Be Internet Awesome - Strong & Secure!**

  - **LO:** Explain password importance ("Secure Your Secrets"); identify stronger password traits (length, mix); brainstorm memorable strong password *ideas*; understand the role of two-factor authentication (2FA); recognize online tricks (phishing).

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Why Passwords?:** Ask: "What needs password?" (Email, games). Explain passwords = secret keys. Use BIA slogan: "Secure Your Secrets."

    2.  **Strong Password Ideas:** Review why easy passwords bad. Brainstorm stronger ideas:

        - Phrase: "My green dino loves leaves!" -\> MgdL0v3sL3@ves!

        - Combine: "Robot+Castle+8" -\> R0b0tC@stle8!

        - Length: Longer = better.  
          CRITICAL: Stress ideas only. Never use examples or real passwords. Create real ones privately, never share.

    3.  What is 2FA?: Explain that some accounts need two things to unlock—this is called Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). It's like opening a treasure chest that needs both a key (your password) and a secret code (sent to your phone or email). It makes your account even safer.

        - Analogy: "A treasure chest with two locks is harder for a pirate to break into!"

        - Ask: "Why does using two steps make it harder for someone else to log into your stuff?"

        - Reinforce: If you ever see a screen asking for a second step or a code, always talk to a grown-up first.

  4.  **Play Tower of Treasure:** Play [**Google Interland: Tower of Treasure**](https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/interland/tower-of-treasure). Discuss *why* game suggests changes (length, numbers, symbols).

    5.  **Spotting Tricks (Phishing Review):** Show simple fake examples (Notepad): "Account locked! Click here enter password." or "You won! Enter name/address." Ask: "Look real? Why/why not? What do?"

    6.  **Reinforce "Talk It Out":** Ask: "What if site asks password unexpectedly, or friend asks?" (Never share, tell grown-up!).

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What makes a password stronger?" "What should you do if a message asks for your password?" "Why might a website ask for two things to log in?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Safety Poster"**

  - **Instruction:** "Make reminder poster! Open Paint 3D or [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). Create poster showing one 'Be Internet Awesome' rule (Be Kind, Be Careful, Be Strong)."

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Digital art (Paint 3D/Canva), recalling/representing BIA safety concepts.

:::tip Flexibility
If spreadsheets seem dry, keep data entry minimal and focus on the visual chart creation. If the child enjoys organizing data, create a slightly larger table or explore simple sorting.
:::

:::info Final Project Link
Sometimes projects need organized information! While maybe not for this exact story project, knowing how to use spreadsheets and make charts is a useful skill for school projects or tracking collections later.
:::

- **Guided Session 1: Data Detectives**

  - **LO:** Define spreadsheet (organizing grid); identify rows/columns/cells; enter text/numbers; select cells/ranges; use Fill Color; save/name spreadsheet.

  - **Activity:**

  1.  **Introduce Spreadsheets:** Open Excel/[Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/). Explain = super-organized table of cells, good for lists/numbers. Point out Columns (A,B,C), Rows (1,2,3), Cells (A1, B3). Click cells, name addresses.

    2.  **Create Headers:** Based on chosen theme (e.g., A1: "Animal", B1: "Habitat", C1: "Can it Fly?"). Explain headers.

    3.  **Enter Data:** Guide entering data for 3-4 items relevant to headers (e.g., Eagle/Mountains/Yes, Penguin/Antarctica/No, Lion/Savanna/No). Practice clicking correct cell first.

    4.  **Format Cells:** Select header row (A1:C1 or click Row '1'). Use 'Fill Color' (paint bucket) tool, choose color. (Optional) Select data area, apply different fill.

    5.  **Save:** File -\> Save As (Excel) or name file (Google Sheets). Save in "My Projects" as "Animal Data".

    6.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What is a 'cell' in a spreadsheet?" "How did we make the headers look different?"

- **Guided Session 2: Charting the Stars**

  - **LO:** Understand charts visualize data; select adjacent or non-adjacent data columns; use 'Insert Chart'; choose simple chart type (Bar/Pie); identify chart elements (title, axes/legend, bars/slices); interpret chart simply.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Why Charts?:** Look at table. Ask: "How many animals in our list can fly?" (Requires reading). Explain charts = visual picture, easier comparisons.

    2.  **Select Data:** Need Animal Names & 'Can it Fly?' data.

        - Click & drag to select Animal names (e.g., A2:A5).

        - Hold **Ctrl** key (Cmd on Mac), *while holding*, click & drag to select 'Can it Fly?' data (e.g., C2:C5). Both selected. Let go. (Or select adjacent columns if dataset allows, e.g., Animal & Speed).

    3.  **Insert Chart:** Go to 'Insert' menu -\> 'Chart'.

    4.  **Choose Chart Type:** Choose 'Bar Chart' (Column) or 'Pie Chart'. (A Pie chart might work here to show Yes/No proportions).

    5.  **Explore Chart:** Point out: Title, Axes/Legend (explains colors/sections), Bars/Slices.

    6.  **Interpret Chart:** Ask: "Looking at the chart, is it easy to see how many animals can/cannot fly?" (Or "Which animal is fastest?" if using speed data). Emphasize visual comparison.

    7.  **Save:** Save spreadsheet with chart.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What does a chart help us do with information?" "What did the different parts of the chart show us?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Data Explorer"**

  - **Instruction:** "Add more data! Open the spreadsheet we made ('Animal Data' or similar). Add one more row with information about another animal/dinosaur/character based on our headers (you can use [Kiddle](https://www.kiddle.co/) to look up info if needed). Type the info into the next empty row. Now, look at the chart. Did the new information appear automatically? If not, click the chart, look for options like 'Edit data range' (ask me if you need help!), & see if you can add the new row." (Focus on data entry & observation).

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Spreadsheet data entry, interacting with charts, observation, potentially updating chart data (problem-solving/asking for help).

  - **Setup:** Access to spreadsheet file, Kiddle access (optional), visual timer.

    3.  **Select Idea:** Review list. Discuss which is most fun *and* achievable with learned tools. Choose one concept.

    4.  **Outline:** Open Notepad. Map story together:

        - Type "Beginning:", ask "How start? Character? Setting? Goal?" Type 1-2 sentence summary.

        - Type "Middle:", ask "What next? Journey? Challenges? Discoveries?" Type 2-3 sentence summary.

        - Type "End:", ask "How finish? Goal achieved? What happens?" Type 1-2 sentence summary.  
          Read outline together.

    5.  **Choose Tools:** Look at outline. Discuss: "Tool for drawing characters?" (Paint 3D/Canva). "Tool for animation?" (Scratch). "Tool for showing story with pics/text?" (Slides/Clipchamp). "Tool for designing object?" (Tinkercad). Decide on 1-3 main tools & final format (e.g., "Paint 3D drawings into Clipchamp video with text").

    6.  **Save Outline:** Save Notepad file in project folder (e.g., "My Story Project") as "Story Outline".

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What's the story we decided to tell?" "What tools are we planning to use?"

- **Guided Session 2: Building the Universe - Asset Creation**

  - **LO:** Create dedicated project folder; begin creating initial digital assets (images, code, models) based on plan/tools; practice using tools purposefully; save assets into project folder with descriptive names.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Set Up Project Folder:** If needed, create project folder (e.g., "My Story Project") in "My Projects". Explain organization.

  - Have typing practice site ready.

  - Prepare/print visual instruction card.

  - Set up visual timer.

:::tip Flexibility
Assembly can be tricky. Focus on getting the main sequence together first, then refine. If one part is too difficult, simplify the story or find an alternative way using known skills. Encourage problem-solving but be ready to assist.
:::

- **Guided Session 1: Assembling the Adventure**

  - **LO:** Open main project file; import/load created assets; begin arranging assets in sequence per outline; add initial text elements; identify/attempt basic problem-solving with guidance.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Open Main Tool & Project:** Launch assembly software (Clipchamp, Slides, Scratch). Open project file or start new.

    2.  **Import Assets:** Use 'Import'/'Insert Image'/'Upload sprite' to bring in assets from project folder. *(For Tinkercad: Use Windows Snipping Tool/Snip & Sketch to capture images of design, save as PNG/JPG in project folder, then import).*

    3.  **Arrange Sequence:** Put pieces together per outline:

        - *Clipchamp:* Drag images/clips onto timeline in order.

        - *Slides:* Create slides for story parts, insert images/text.

        - *Scratch:* Build scenes (backdrops/sprites), code transitions/actions.

    4.  **Add Text:** Add text overlays/captions (Clipchamp), story text (Slides), say blocks (Scratch).

    5.  **Troubleshooting:** Work through issues together. "Image too small? Resize." "Code not working? Check blocks." "How put pic next to text?" Encourage thinking before giving solution. Explain fixing problems = normal part of creating.

    6.  **Save Progress:** Save main project file often.

    7.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What was the trickiest part about putting the pieces together?" "How did we solve \[specific problem\]?"

- **Guided Session 2: Refining the Journey**

  - **LO:** Review assembled draft critically; identify areas for improvement (pacing, clarity, visuals, missing parts); implement refinements (timing, transitions, content); check overall story flow.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Review Together:** Play/click through current project state.

    2.  **Identify Improvements:** Discuss: "Story make sense? Easy to follow?" "Pics on screen long enough?" (Clipchamp/Slides). "Animations smooth?" (Scratch). "Anything missing from outline?" "Title slide exciting?" Make short list of 1-3 things to adjust.

    3.  **Work on Refinements:** Focus on implementing those 1-3 items:

        - *Pacing:* Adjust clip duration (Clipchamp), slide timing/wait blocks (Slides/Scratch).

        - *Transitions:* Add simple 'Fade'/'Slide' (Slides) or code scene changes (Scratch).

        - *Clarity:* Add text caption, re-word story text.

        - *Visuals:* Change background color, adjust image size, add simple decoration.

    4.  **Check Pacing/Flow:** Play adjusted section again. Ask: "Look/feel better?"

    5.  **Save:** Save updated project.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What change did we make that improved the story the most?" "Why is it important to review our work?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Adding Polish"**

  - **Instruction:** "Make project even better! Open main story project file. Choose one small thing from our improvement list, or your own idea. Maybe: Add background color (Scratch)? Change title font (Slides)? Find one more pic (Kiddle first!) for video (Clipchamp)? Make transition smoother?"

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Project refinement, attention to detail, independent problem-solving (minor), using tools for specific adjustments.

  - **Setup:** Access to main project file, list of potential improvements (optional), visual timer.

## Independent Session Setup Tips

1.  **Create visual instruction cards:** Simple step-by-step guidance with pictures for each week's independent task.

2.  **Set up a visual timer:** Helps the child manage the 20 minutes independently.

3.  **Prepare a "Help Card":** Include 2-3 common troubleshooting tips relevant to the week's tools (e.g., "How to Save," "Undo Button," "Check Wi-Fi," "Ask for Help if Stuck for 5 mins"). Update this card as new tools are introduced.

4.  **Create a simple achievement tracker:** A chart (themed to child's interests) where they can place stickers after completing independent work adds motivation and visual progress.

5.  **Establish a "show and tell" routine:** After each independent session, spend 1-2 minutes letting the child briefly share what they created, discovered, or found challenging.

## Materials for Independent Sessions

- Printed instruction cards with visuals (specific to each week's task).

- Simple troubleshooting guide ("Help Card") with pictures.

- Achievement chart and stickers.

- Pre-loaded templates or starter files when appropriate (e.g., document templates, Scratch starters, presentation files to add to).

- Quick-reference sheets for commonly used tools (e.g., Paint 3D toolbar, Scratch block categories, Tinkercad view controls).

This fully detailed and generalized 18-week curriculum should now be suitable for sharing and adaptable for various children's interests.
