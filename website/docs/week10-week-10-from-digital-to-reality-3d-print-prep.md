# Week 10: From Digital to Reality - 3D Print Prep

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 10 LOs and Activities.

  - Ensure browser access to [<u>Printables.com</u>](https://www.printables.com/) and/or [<u>Thingiverse</u>](https://www.thingiverse.com/).

  - Have your specific slicer software ([<u>Cura</u>](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/), [<u>PrusaSlicer</u>](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/), etc.) installed and configured for your 3D printer. Refresh understanding of loading STL, basic manipulation, slicing, previewing.

  - Ensure the 3D printer is operational (filament loaded, bed clear, level). Choose a quick-printing, simple STL beforehand as a backup.

  - Have the typing practice site ready.

  - Prepare/print the visual instruction card for the independent session.

  - Set up the visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* Spend more time browsing models if the child enjoys it. If slicer software seems too complex, focus on the concepts (slicing like bread) and just demonstrate the preview, handling most operations yourself initially. The goal is understanding the process, not mastering the slicer yet.

  - *Safety Note:* Emphasize that 3D printers have hot parts and moving components and must only be operated with close adult supervision.

- **Guided Session 1: Finding Fantastic Prints**

  - **LO:** Navigate model websites ([<u>Printables.com</u>](https://www.printables.com/), [<u>Thingiverse</u>](https://www.thingiverse.com/)); search for models; understand STL files; assess basic printability; download simple STL file.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Explore Model Sites:** Open [<u>Printables.com</u>](https://www.printables.com/). Explain as online library for 3D models shared by people for printing. Browse main page.

    2.  **Search for Models:** Use search bar for interests (e.g., "dinosaur," "car," "castle," "animal"). Browse results together.

    3.  **Analyze Models:** Click interesting models. Look at pictures. Read description briefly. Ask: "Look easy/hard to print?" Point out overhangs/thin parts. Aim for simple/solid first print.

    4.  **Download STL:** Select simple model. Find download button/Files tab. Download ".stl" file. Note save location ('Downloads'). Explain STL = shape recipe.

    5.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What kind of file do we download for 3D printing?" "What makes a model look 'easy' to print?"

- **Guided Session 2: Slicing & Printing Magic!**

  - **LO:** Understand slicer purpose (STL -\> G-code layers); Open STL in slicer; Use basic move/scale/rotate; Initiate 'Slice' with defaults; Use preview function; (Supervised) Start small 3D print.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Introduce Slicer:** Open your slicer (Cura/PrusaSlicer). Explain: "This software takes the STL shape, slices it into thin layers (like bread), figures out the nozzle path for each layer, and saves instructions (G-code) our printer understands."

    2.  **Load STL:** Use 'Open File'/'Import' to load downloaded STL. Model appears on virtual bed.

    3.  **Basic Manipulation:** Show tools: Move (center model), Scale (resize if needed), Rotate (place flattest side down).

    4.  **Slice & Preview:** Select basic settings (PLA material, 0.2mm layer). Click 'Slice'. Wait. Find 'Preview'/'Layer View'. Use slider to move through layers, showing build process. Point out nozzle path lines.

    5.  **Start Print (Supervised):**

        - Save G-code: Click 'Save/Export G-code'. Save to printer's SD card/send via network.

        - Prepare Printer: **Adult supervision crucial.** Ensure bed clean, filament loaded. Explain printer parts briefly (bed, nozzle, filament). Emphasize **hot parts** and moving pieces - **do not touch** while running.

        - Load & Print: Insert SD card/select file on printer. Start print *together*.

        - Watch First Layers: Watch first layers adhere. Explain slow process, needs supervision. Reiterate safety.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What does the slicer software do to the 3D model?" "What did the layer preview show us?" "What's an important safety rule around the 3D printer?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Printable Wishlist"**

  - **Instruction:** "Dream about future prints! Go back to [<u>Printables.com</u>](https://www.printables.com/) or [<u>Thingiverse</u>](https://www.thingiverse.com/). Search for things you like (dinosaurs, cars, characters, useful things). Find three cool models you might like to print someday. Open Notepad (built-in). Try to copy the web address (link) for each model and paste it into Notepad, or just write down their names."

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Website navigation, searching, identifying desired items, copy/paste (optional practice), saving info in text file.

  - **Setup:** Access to model websites, Notepad, visual timer.
