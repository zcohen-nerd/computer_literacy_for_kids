# Week 2: Window Wonders & Folder Forts

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 2 LOs and Activities.

  - Ensure Calculator, Paint 3D, File Explorer, Notepad (or simple text editor) are easily accessible.

  - Prepare file/folder analogy (toy bins, drawers, book shelves).

  - Prepare/print the visual instruction card.

  - Set up the visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* If window management is intuitive, spend more time on file/folder concepts. If file organization is confusing, use physical folders/papers first as an analogy before moving to the computer.

- **Guided Session 1: Exploring the Desktop**

  - **LO:** Identify Desktop, Taskbar, Start Menu; open apps; use window controls (min/max/close); arrange windows.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Tour:** Point out Desktop, Taskbar, Start Menu; explain functions simply (workspace, quick access, find programs).

    2.  **Launch Apps:** Open Calculator & Paint 3D via Start Menu. Show app icons on Taskbar. Pin Paint 3D (Right-click icon -\> Pin).

    3.  **Window Controls:** Practice minimize, maximize/restore, close buttons. Observe effects.

    4.  **Arrange Windows:** Move windows by dragging top bar. Try arranging side-by-side (Windows snap feature).

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What does the 'X' button do on a window?" "How can you find a program if it's not on the taskbar?"

- **Guided Session 2: Building File Homes**

  - **LO:** Define file/folder (analogy); open File Explorer; navigate; create/name new folder; create sub-folders; use 'Save As'; save Notepad file to specific folder.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Analogy:** Explain files (drawings, stories) & folders (containers). Use toy bin/drawer analogy.

    2.  **Open File Explorer:** Use taskbar icon or Start Menu search.

    3.  **Navigate:** Show common locations (Desktop, Documents). Click around.

    4.  **Create Main Folder:** In Documents, Right-click -\> New -\> Folder. Name "My Projects".

    5.  **Create Sub-folders:** Open "My Projects". Create sub-folders based on child's interests (e.g., "Drawings," "Stories," "Dinosaur_Pics," "Car_Designs"). Explain organization.

    6.  **Open Notepad & Type:** Open Notepad. Type name or simple sentence.

    7.  **Save As:** File -\> Save As... Explain choosing location/name.

    8.  **Navigate & Save:** In 'Save As' window, navigate: Documents -\> My Projects -\> Stories (or other relevant folder). Name file "First Story". Click Save.

    9.  **Verify:** Close Notepad. Use File Explorer to find and open the saved file.

    10. Basic Troubleshooting Skills: Introduce a simple checklist for when things don't work right. Explain this is like a â€œtoolboxâ€ for solving little problems on your own.

        - Try clicking again."

        - "Is it already open in the background?"

        - "Try closing it and opening it again."

        - "Check if the Wi-Fi is working."

        - "Ask an adult if you're still stuck after a few minutes."

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "Why is it helpful to put files into folders?" "What does 'Save As' let us do that 'Save' doesn't always do?" (Choose location/name first time) "Whatâ€™s one thing you can try if something isnâ€™t working right?".

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Folder Fun"**

  - **Instruction:** "Practice organizing! In 'My Projects', create two new folders for things *you* like (maybe 'Favorite Games', 'Cool Creatures'). Then, open Paint 3D, draw a picture for one new folder, & use 'Save As' to save it inside that folder."

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Creating folders, saving files using 'Save As', basic Paint 3D.

  - **Setup:** Simple visual instruction card, File Explorer, Paint 3D.
