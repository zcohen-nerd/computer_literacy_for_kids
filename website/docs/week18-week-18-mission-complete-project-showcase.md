# Week 18: Mission Complete - Project Showcase

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 18 LOs and Activities.

  - Ensure final project file accessible & working. Check for missing final elements (titles, credits, music).

  - Prepare simple prompts for presentation practice.

  - Arrange time/place for family showcase!

  - Have preferred creative tools ready for independent session.

  - Set up visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* Keep the showcase low-pressure and celebratory. Focus on effort and learning, not perfection. The "Free Create" session should be purely fun and exploratory.

- **Guided Session 1: Final Touches & Rehearsal**

  - **LO:** Add final elements (title, end screen/credits, music); conduct final review for consistency/completeness/errors; practice presenting/demonstrating smoothly; practice explaining story/creation process.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Add Final Elements:**

        - *Title Screen:* Ensure clear title & "By \[Child's Name\]".

        - *End Screen/Credits:* Add final slide/scene saying "The End". Optional: add simple credits ("Story/Art by \[Name\]", "Tools used: Paint 3D, Clipchamp").

        - *Music (if applicable):* Add suitable background track if using video/slideshow & not done yet; adjust volume.

    2.  **Final Review:** Play through entire project one last time. Check typos, glitches, timing, sound. Make final small corrections.

    3.  **Presentation Practice:** Have the child run through presenting:

        - Start project.

        - Explain story as it plays.

        - Pause & practice explaining *how* a part was made ("How did character move?" "Which tool drew this?").

        - Practice clicking/advancing smoothly.

        - Practice saying "Thank you for watching!" at end.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "Are you proud of your project?" "What are you most excited to show?"

- **Guided Session 2: Project Showcase!**

  - **LO:** Confidently present completed project to audience; articulate story/creation process; celebrate accomplishment; reflect on skills learned.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Set the Stage:** Gather family/audience. Dim lights if helpful.

    2.  **Introduction:** Let the child introduce project ("This is my Digital Creation Story about...").

    3.  **Presentation:** They play/click through project, explaining as practiced. Offer quiet support only if needed.

    4.  **Q&A / Applause:** Lead applause! Encourage positive audience questions ("Favorite part to make?" "How did you get the idea?").

    5.  **Celebration:** Congratulate enthusiastically! Talk about favorite parts of the whole 18-week learning journey. Which skills did they enjoy most?

  - **Reflection (Post-Showcase):** Ask: "How did it feel to share your project?" "What was the best part about making it?" "What computer skill do you want to practice more?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Free Create!"**

  - **Instruction:** "Congratulations on finishing your amazing story project! You've learned so much. For our very last session, you get 20 minutes of 'Free Create' time. You can use *any* of the computer tools we learned about this whole time (Paint 3D, Scratch, Tinkercad, Clipchamp, Notepad, Slides, etc.) to make absolutely anything you want! Draw, code, design, write â€“ just have fun creating!"

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Creative exploration, independent use of learned software tools, reinforcing enjoyment of digital creation.

  - **Setup:** Access to preferred software tools, visual timer.
