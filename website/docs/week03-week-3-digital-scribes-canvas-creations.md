# Week 3: Digital Scribes & Canvas Creations

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 3 LOs and Activities.

  - Ensure Notepad/WordPad (or other simple text editor) and Paint 3D (or similar drawing tool) are accessible. Check formatting options if using WordPad/Word/Google Docs.

  - Prepare/print visual instruction card & optional Paint 3D reference sheet.

  - Set up visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* If typing is challenging, focus on accuracy over quantity, or use on-screen keyboard temporarily. If Paint 3D is highly engaging, allow more exploration or suggest the 2-3 panel mini-story for the independent session.

- **Guided Session 1: Word Wizardry**

  - **LO:** Use simple text editor; practice typing sentences (letters, space, enter, backspace); select text; apply basic formatting (optional: bold, size, color).

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Open Editor:** Open Notepad/WordPad. Explain as digital paper.

    2.  **Typing Practice:** Type 2-3 sentences about a favorite topic (animal, game, place). Guide key usage (Shift, space, enter, backspace). Focus on accuracy.

    3.  **Selecting Text:** Demonstrate click & drag to select text. Practice selecting words/sentences. Explain selection tells computer what to change.

    4.  **Basic Formatting (WordPad/Word/Docs Only - Optional):** Show Bold (B), Size dropdown, Color options. Practice on selected text (e.g., make title bold).

    5.  **Save:** File -\> Save As... Navigate to "Stories" folder (or relevant one). Save as "My Story".

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "How do you fix a typing mistake?" "What does selecting text let you do?"

- **Guided Session 2: Paint 3D Palette**

  - **LO:** Use Paint 3D tools (Brushes, 2D Shapes, Colors, Fill); understand digital canvas; save artwork to folder.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Open Paint 3D:** Explain canvas.

    2.  **Explore Brushes:** Try marker/pencil. Change colors via palette.

    3.  **Explore 2D Shapes:** Draw shapes (circle, square). Finalize (checkmark). Change fill/line color via options.

    4.  **Fill Tool:** Draw closed shape. Use Fill tool (paint bucket) inside. Explain limitation (works best on closed shapes).

    5.  **Create Scene:** Combine tools to draw scene based on interests (favorite place, fantasy creature, vehicle). *Storytelling Prompt:* "Could you draw a character, and then another picture showing where they live or what they are doing?"

    6.  **Save:** Menu -\> Save As -\> Image. Navigate to "Drawings". Name "My Drawing". Save.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What was your favorite tool in Paint 3D today?" "What happens if you try to fill a shape that isn't closed?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Story Picture Sequence"**

  - **Instruction:** "Let's tell a tiny story with pictures! Open Paint 3D. Think of a very simple 2-step story based on your interests (e.g., 1. Dinosaur sleeping. 2. Dinosaur waking up! OR 1. Car driving. 2. Car stops!). Draw the *first* picture, save it ('Story_Pic1'). Then, do File -\> New, draw the *second* picture, and save it ('Story_Pic2') in your 'Drawings' folder."

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Paint 3D tools, saving multiple files, simple visual sequencing/storytelling.

  - **Setup:** Visual timer, Paint 3D quick reference sheet (optional), access to "Drawings" folder.
