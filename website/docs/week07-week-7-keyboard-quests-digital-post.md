# Week 7: Keyboard Quests & Digital Post

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 7 LOs and Activities.

  - Have typing practice site ready ([<u>TypingClub</u>](https://www.typingclub.com/) / [<u>BBC Dance Mat</u>](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zf2f9j6/articles/z3c6tfr)) and know child's current level/lesson.

  - Prepare for supervised email practice: Decide on WordPad drafting or supervised child-safe email account (have login, be comfortable supervising).

  - Prepare discussion points/scenarios for email safety, linking back to Week 1/BIA.

  - Prepare/print visual instruction card.

  - Set up visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* If typing is progressing well, introduce punctuation keys. If email concepts are tricky, spend more time drafting offline or discussing safety scenarios.

- **Guided Session 1: Typing Tune-Up**

  - **LO:** Continue practicing touch typing (accuracy/rhythm); identify keys without looking; complete lesson/level in typing program.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Posture Check:** Review good typing posture (sit tall, feet flat, wrists straight).

    2.  **Typing Practice (15-20 min):** Log in to [<u>TypingClub</u>](https://www.typingclub.com/) or [<u>BBC Dance Mat Typing</u>](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zf2f9j6/articles/z3c6tfr). Work through next lesson/level. Offer encouragement.

    3.  **Keyboard Game (Optional):** Quick "find the key" game without looking (e.g., "Find P," "Find Shift").

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "Which keys are easiest/hardest for you right now?" "Did you notice your accuracy improving?"

- **Guided Session 2: Email Essentials**

  - **LO:** Identify email interface parts (To, Subject, Body, Send); understand purpose; compose simple, polite email (greeting/closing); understand basic email safety (known people, no strange links/attachments, tell adult if weird).

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Email Purpose:** Discuss email use (messages, pictures fast). Compare to letters.

    2.  **Interface Tour (Simulated/Supervised):** Use WordPad draft or supervised email account. Point out 'To' (address), 'Subject' (title), 'Body' (message). Show 'Send' button (emphasize not clicking without permission).

    3.  **Compose Practice Email:** Draft simple email to family/pretend:

        - **To:** Type/select address (supervised).

        - **Subject:** Write short title ("Hello!", "My Scratch Project"). Explain good subjects help receiver.

        - **Body:** Start with greeting ("Hi Grandma,"). Write 1-2 simple sentences ("I learned email today. I practiced typing."). Add closing ("From,", "Love,"), then name. Review politeness.

    4.  **Email Safety Discussion:** Ask: "Who should we email?" (Known/trusted people). "What if you get email from unknown person?" (Don't open, tell adult). "What if email asks for password/address?" (Never tell, tell adult). Explain not clicking links/opening attachments unless sure. Reinforce: **"When in Doubt, Talk It Out!"**

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What are the three main parts of writing an email?" "What's one important safety rule for email?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Typing & Telling"**

  - **Instruction:** "First, practice typing for 10 minutes using our typing game ([<u>TypingClub</u>](https://www.typingclub.com/) or [<u>BBC Dance Mat</u>](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zf2f9j6/articles/z3c6tfr)). Try to beat your last score or finish a new lesson! After typing, open Notepad (built-in) and write one sentence telling me something you learned or practiced in the typing game today (like 'I practiced the E key' or 'I got 3 stars')."

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Typing practice, recalling information, writing a simple sentence using Notepad.

  - **Setup:** Access to typing game, Notepad, visual timer.
