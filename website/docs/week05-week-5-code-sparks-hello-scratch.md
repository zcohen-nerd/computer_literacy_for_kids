# Week 5: Code Sparks - Hello Scratch!

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 5 LOs and Activities.

  - Ensure Scratch parent/teacher and student accounts are created and login works ([<u>Scratch</u>](https://scratch.mit.edu/)).

  - Refresh understanding of Scratch interface & basic Motion/Looks/Events/Control blocks.

  - Have the typing practice site ready.

  - Prepare/print visual instruction card.

  - Set up visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* If block coding is intuitive, challenge them to combine more blocks or explore Sounds early. If confusing, stick to simple 1-2 block scripts and repeat clicking them.

  - *Final Project Link:* "We're starting to learn Scratch! This is a tool we could use to make parts of your final 'Digital Creation Story' move, like making characters walk or objects fly."

- **Guided Session 1: Cracking the Code**

  - **LO:** Define coding (instructions); navigate Scratch interface (Sprite, Stage, Blocks); understand block categories by color; drag/drop blocks; use basic Motion blocks (move, turn).

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Intro to Coding:** Explain coding = recipe/instructions for computer; blocks = ingredients/steps. Show simple recipe vs. Scratch script.

    2.  **Scratch Interface Tour:** Log in to [<u>Scratch</u>](https://scratch.mit.edu/), click 'Create'. Point out Stage (action area), Sprite (character), Block Palette (block menu), Scripting Area (building space).

    3.  **Explore Blocks:** Click different categories (Motion-Blue, Looks-Purple, Sound-Pink, Events-Yellow, Control-Orange) to show variety. Explain colors group similar actions.

    4.  **First Script:** Drag move 10 steps (Motion) to scripting area. Click block -\> Sprite moves. Drag turn 15 degrees. Click block -\> Sprite turns.

    5.  **Experiment:** Let the child drag out & click a few different Motion blocks (e.g., go to random position, glide) to see effects.

    6.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons. Focus on home row.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What does the 'Motion' block category help the sprite do?" "What happens when you click a block in the scripting area?"

- **Guided Session 2: Making Sprites Move & Talk**

  - **LO:** Understand Event blocks (when green flag clicked); connect blocks into scripts; use Looks blocks (say, think, next costume); use Control blocks (wait).

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Starting Scripts:** Introduce 'Events' (yellow). Drag out when green flag clicked. Explain this is the "Go!" button for the script attached below it.

    2.  **Connect Blocks:** Snap move 10 steps under the event block. Click green flag icon above stage -\> Sprite moves. Snap turn 15 degrees below move block. Click flag again. Show how blocks run in order.

    3.  **Looks Blocks:** Go to 'Looks' (purple). Add say Hello! for 2 secs. Click flag. Click inside "Hello!" and change text (e.g., "Let's explore!"). Try think Hmmm... for 2 secs. Add next costume block (if sprite has multiple costumes) - click flag repeatedly to see it change appearance.

    4.  **Wait Block:** Go to 'Control' (orange). Add a wait 1 secs block between actions (e.g., move, wait, say, wait, next costume). Click flag, observe the pauses making actions distinct.

    5.  **Save Project:** Click 'File' -\> 'Save now'. Guide the child to click the title box (default "Untitled") above the stage and type a name like "My First Animation". Explain Scratch saves online when logged in.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What does the green flag block do?" "How does the 'wait' block change how the script runs?" "What kind of things can 'Looks' blocks do?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Sprite Explorer"**

  - **Instruction:** "Open your Scratch project (or start a new one). Can you make your sprite do something new when the green flag is clicked? Try adding a block from the 'Sound' category (like 'start sound Meow'), or maybe use a 'Looks' block you haven't tried yet (like 'change color effect'). Experiment and see what happens! Remember to save your changes."

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Scratch interface navigation, experimenting with different block categories (Sound, Looks), building simple scripts, saving work.

  - **Setup:** Access to [<u>Scratch</u>](https://scratch.mit.edu/) (logged in), visual timer.
