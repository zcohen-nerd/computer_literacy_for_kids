# Independent Session Setup Tips

1.  **Create visual instruction cards:** Simple step-by-step guidance with pictures for each week's independent task.

2.  **Set up a visual timer:** Helps the child manage the 20 minutes independently.

3.  **Prepare a "Help Card":** Include 2-3 common troubleshooting tips relevant to the week's tools (e.g., "How to Save," "Undo Button," "Check Wi-Fi," "Ask for Help if Stuck for 5 mins"). Update this card as new tools are introduced.

4.  **Create a simple achievement tracker:** A chart (themed to child's interests) where they can place stickers after completing independent work adds motivation and visual progress.

5.  **Establish a "show and tell" routine:** After each independent session, spend 1-2 minutes letting the child briefly share what they created, discovered, or found challenging.
