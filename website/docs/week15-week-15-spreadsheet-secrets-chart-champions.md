# Week 15: Spreadsheet Secrets & Chart Champions

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 15 LOs and Activities.

  - Choose spreadsheet software (Excel or [<u>Google Sheets</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/)) ensure access/login. Familiarize with data entry, cell formatting (fill), selecting adjacent & non-adjacent data, inserting simple bar/pie charts.

  - Prepare simple dataset relevant to child's interests (e.g., Favorite Animals & Speeds, Game Characters & Powers, Types of Dinosaurs & Diets).

  - Have typing practice site ready.

  - Have Kiddle access ready for independent session fact lookup (optional).

  - Prepare/print visual instruction card.

  - Set up visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* If spreadsheets seem dry, keep data entry minimal and focus on the visual chart creation. If the child enjoys organizing data, create a slightly larger table or explore simple sorting.

  - *Final Project Link:* "Sometimes projects need organized information! While maybe not for *this* story project, knowing how to use spreadsheets and make charts is a useful skill for school projects or tracking collections later."

- **Guided Session 1: Data Detectives**

  - **LO:** Define spreadsheet (organizing grid); identify rows/columns/cells; enter text/numbers; select cells/ranges; use Fill Color; save/name spreadsheet.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Introduce Spreadsheets:** Open Excel/[<u>Google Sheets</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/). Explain = super-organized table of cells, good for lists/numbers. Point out Columns (A,B,C), Rows (1,2,3), Cells (A1, B3). Click cells, name addresses.

    2.  **Create Headers:** Based on chosen theme (e.g., A1: "Animal", B1: "Habitat", C1: "Can it Fly?"). Explain headers.

    3.  **Enter Data:** Guide entering data for 3-4 items relevant to headers (e.g., Eagle/Mountains/Yes, Penguin/Antarctica/No, Lion/Savanna/No). Practice clicking correct cell first.

    4.  **Format Cells:** Select header row (A1:C1 or click Row '1'). Use 'Fill Color' (paint bucket) tool, choose color. (Optional) Select data area, apply different fill.

    5.  **Save:** File -\> Save As (Excel) or name file (Google Sheets). Save in "My Projects" as "Animal Data".

    6.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What is a 'cell' in a spreadsheet?" "How did we make the headers look different?"

- **Guided Session 2: Charting the Stars**

  - **LO:** Understand charts visualize data; select adjacent or non-adjacent data columns; use 'Insert Chart'; choose simple chart type (Bar/Pie); identify chart elements (title, axes/legend, bars/slices); interpret chart simply.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Why Charts?:** Look at table. Ask: "How many animals in our list can fly?" (Requires reading). Explain charts = visual picture, easier comparisons.

    2.  **Select Data:** Need Animal Names & 'Can it Fly?' data.

        - Click & drag to select Animal names (e.g., A2:A5).

        - Hold **Ctrl** key (Cmd on Mac), *while holding*, click & drag to select 'Can it Fly?' data (e.g., C2:C5). Both selected. Let go. (Or select adjacent columns if dataset allows, e.g., Animal & Speed).

    3.  **Insert Chart:** Go to 'Insert' menu -\> 'Chart'.

    4.  **Choose Chart Type:** Choose 'Bar Chart' (Column) or 'Pie Chart'. (A Pie chart might work here to show Yes/No proportions).

    5.  **Explore Chart:** Point out: Title, Axes/Legend (explains colors/sections), Bars/Slices.

    6.  **Interpret Chart:** Ask: "Looking at the chart, is it easy to see how many animals can/cannot fly?" (Or "Which animal is fastest?" if using speed data). Emphasize visual comparison.

    7.  **Save:** Save spreadsheet with chart.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What does a chart help us do with information?" "What did the different parts of the chart show us?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Data Explorer"**

  - **Instruction:** "Add more data! Open the spreadsheet we made ('Animal Data' or similar). Add one more row with information about another animal/dinosaur/character based on our headers (you can use [<u>Kiddle</u>](https://www.kiddle.co/) to look up info if needed). Type the info into the next empty row. Now, look at the chart. Did the new information appear automatically? If not, click the chart, look for options like 'Edit data range' (ask me if you need help!), & see if you can add the new row." (Focus on data entry & observation).

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Spreadsheet data entry, interacting with charts, observation, potentially updating chart data (problem-solving/asking for help).

  - **Setup:** Access to spreadsheet file, Kiddle access (optional), visual timer.
