# Week 11: AI Adventures & Smart Sparks

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 11 LOs and Activities.

  - Ensure working login for [<u>ChatGPT</u>](https://chat.openai.com/) (or other chatbot) and prepare for close supervision.

  - Prepare fun, age-appropriate prompts for Session 1. Prepare brainstorming and fact-checking prompts for Session 2.

  - Bookmark reliable source for fact-checking ([<u>NASA Space Place</u>](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/), [<u>Nat Geo Kids</u>](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/), museum site).

  - Have Paint 3D ready for independent session.

  - Have typing practice site ready.

  - Prepare/print visual instruction card.

  - Set up visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* If AI concepts are confusing, stick to fun, creative prompts. If highly engaged, explore slightly more complex prompts or creative writing assistance. Emphasize safety rules repeatedly.

  - *Final Project Link:* "AI like ChatGPT can sometimes help us brainstorm ideas for stories, like our final project. But remember, we always need to check facts it gives us!"

- **Guided Session 1: Meeting the AI Helper**

  - **LO:** Define AI simply (pattern-learning program); interact safely with chatbot ([<u>ChatGPT</u>](https://chat.openai.com/)) under supervision; understand AI is tool, not person; reiterate no sharing private info.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Introduce AI:** Explain AI = smart computer program learned from reading lots online. Good at language patterns. Can answer/write like human, but doesn't 'think' or 'feel'.

    2.  **Supervised ChatGPT Interaction:** Log in to [<u>ChatGPT</u>](https://chat.openai.com/). Explain you type prompts first. Use fun prompts based on child's interests:

        - "Tell short funny story: dinosaur learns to fly."

        - "3 interesting facts about \[Favorite Animal\]?"

        - "Write haiku about \[Favorite Vehicle/Place\]."

    3.  **Discuss Responses:** Read answers together. Ask: "Make sense? Interesting? Sound human? Where info from?" (Learned from text).

    4.  **Safety Reminder:** State clearly: "ChatGPT is computer program. Never tell it secrets (full name, address, passwords, private feelings)." Reinforce: **"When in Doubt, Talk It Out!"**

    5.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "Is ChatGPT a person or a computer program?" "What kind of information should we *never* share with it?"

- **Guided Session 2: Creative & Critical AI Use**

  - **LO:** Use AI for creative brainstorming; understand AI can be wrong ("hallucinate"); practice verifying AI facts with trusted source; know to ask adult if AI response is weird/wrong.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **AI for Ideas:** Use [<u>ChatGPT</u>](https://chat.openai.com/) for brainstorming (supervised typing):

        - "5 story ideas: magical creature goes to school."

        - "Cool names for a superhero whose power is super speed."

        - "Describe what imaginary underwater city might look like."  
          Discuss ideas. Explain AI helps spark creativity.

    2.  **Check the Facts:** Ask ChatGPT fact question (e.g., "What is the biggest dinosaur?"). Then verify answer on trusted site (e.g., museum website, Nat Geo Kids). Compare. Explain AI often right, but double-checking important facts is crucial.

    3.  **Discuss "Hallucinations":** Explain simply: "Sometimes AI guesses or makes things up if unsure. Scientists call this 'hallucination'. That's why we check facts."

    4.  **Reinforce "Talk It Out":** Ask: "What if AI says something weird, wrong, or uncomfortable?" (Stop, tell grown-up!).

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "How can AI help us be creative?" "Why is it important to check facts the AI gives us?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "AI Idea Spark"**

  - **Instruction:** "Let's use AI for drawing ideas! Think of a question about your interests (like 'What does a friendly robot dog look like?' or 'Describe a castle made of clouds'). With my help typing into [<u>ChatGPT</u>](https://chat.openai.com/), we'll ask. After reading answer, open Paint 3D & draw picture based on AI's idea!" (Requires parent initiation/supervision of AI).

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Question formulation, creative interpretation, digital art (Paint 3D).

  - **Setup:** Parent help for AI access, Paint 3D access, visual timer.
