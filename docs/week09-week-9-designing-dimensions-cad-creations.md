# Week 9: Designing Dimensions - CAD Creations

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 9 LOs and Activities.

  - Ensure Tinkercad login is ready.

  - Familiarize yourself with the Text shape, Ruler tool, and Snap Grid settings in Tinkercad.

  - Prepare discussion points linking design to purpose.

  - Have the typing practice site ready.

  - Prepare/print the visual instruction card for the independent session.

  - Set up the visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* If text tool is fun, let the child experiment more with fonts/sizes. If precision tools (ruler/snap) are difficult, focus on visual alignment first and introduce precision gradually.

- **Guided Session 1: Designing with Purpose**

  - **LO:** Brainstorm simple object with purpose; use Text shape tool; modify text content/font; combine Text with other shapes (align/group); rename Tinkercad designs.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Design Thinking:** Ask: "What small thing could we design that's useful/fun?" (tag, stand, keychain, simple custom block). Choose idea. Discuss *why* it might be useful.

    2.  **Sketch (Optional):** Quick paper sketch.

    3.  **Add Text Shape:** Find 'Text' shape (right menu), drag to Workplane.

    4.  **Modify Text:** Select Text shape. Use Inspector window (top right) to change 'Text' field (name/initial/word). Explore 'Font' options. Adjust height/bevel.

    5.  **Combine with Base:** Drag base shape (flat box for tag). Position Text on/near base. Resize text/base. Use Align tool (select both, click Align) to center text.

    6.  **Group:** Select both text and base. Click 'Group'.

    7.  **Rename Design:** Click default name (top left). Type descriptive name ("Name Tag"). Press Enter. Explain helps find project later.

    8.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "How did we add letters in Tinkercad?" "Why did we group the text and the base together?"

- **Guided Session 2: Refining & Coloring**

  - **LO:** Use Ruler tool for precise dimensions; adjust Snap Grid for precision; change shape/group color; inspect designs from multiple angles (View Cube).

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Ruler Tool:** Drag 'Ruler' (right menu) near object. Select object. Dimension lines appear. Click number to type exact size (e.g., make tag 50mm long). Drag ruler away to dismiss. Practice making a cube exactly 20mm x 20mm x 20mm.

    2.  **Snap Grid:** Point out 'Snap Grid' (bottom right). Change 1.0mm -\> 0.1mm -\> drag shape slowly (finer movement). Change back to 1.0mm. Explain use cases (big steps vs tiny adjustments).

    3.  **Change Color:** Select object/shape. Click solid color circle (Inspector window). Choose new color. Explain visualization purpose. Show 'Multicolor' option for groups if applicable.

    4.  **Inspect Views:** Use View Cube (top left) systematically. Click 'Top', 'Front', 'Left'. Ask: "Is it aligned? Right height?" Use orbit (right-drag) for corners. Click 'Home' icon. Emphasize checking all angles for building accurately.

    5.  **Refine Design:** Use tools (Ruler, Snap Grid, Colors, Views) to refine previous object or start new simple design needing precision (e.g., box with lid, ensuring lid dimensions roughly match box opening).

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "How does the Ruler tool help make things exact?" "Why is it important to look at your design from different sides when building?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "My Own Creation"**

  - **Instruction:** "Keep creating in 3D! Go into [<u>Tinkercad</u>](https://www.tinkercad.com/). Either improve the design from our lesson (maybe use the Ruler to make it an exact size, add more detail, change color), OR start something new! Try designing a character from your favorite game, a cool pattern using shapes, or a futuristic vehicle. Remember to use the view controls!"

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Tinkercad skills (grouping, holes, color, text, ruler, snap grid, view controls), creative design, precision adjustments.

  - **Setup:** Tinkercad access, visual timer.
