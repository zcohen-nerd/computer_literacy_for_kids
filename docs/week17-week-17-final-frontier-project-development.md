# Week 17: Final Frontier - Project Development

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 17 LOs and Activities.

  - Ensure access to main assembly tool (Clipchamp, Slides, Scratch) & project folder with assets.

  - Be ready to help troubleshoot basic integration issues (importing, arranging, simple code debug). Know how to take screenshots if using Tinkercad assets.

  - Have typing practice site ready.

  - Prepare/print visual instruction card.

  - Set up visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* Assembly can be tricky. Focus on getting the main sequence together first, then refine. If one part is too difficult, simplify the story or find an alternative way using known skills. Encourage problem-solving but be ready to assist.

- **Guided Session 1: Assembling the Adventure**

  - **LO:** Open main project file; import/load created assets; begin arranging assets in sequence per outline; add initial text elements; identify/attempt basic problem-solving with guidance.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Open Main Tool & Project:** Launch assembly software (Clipchamp, Slides, Scratch). Open project file or start new.

    2.  **Import Assets:** Use 'Import'/'Insert Image'/'Upload sprite' to bring in assets from project folder. *(For Tinkercad: Use Windows Snipping Tool/Snip & Sketch to capture images of design, save as PNG/JPG in project folder, then import).*

    3.  **Arrange Sequence:** Put pieces together per outline:

        - *Clipchamp:* Drag images/clips onto timeline in order.

        - *Slides:* Create slides for story parts, insert images/text.

        - *Scratch:* Build scenes (backdrops/sprites), code transitions/actions.

    4.  **Add Text:** Add text overlays/captions (Clipchamp), story text (Slides), say blocks (Scratch).

    5.  **Troubleshooting:** Work through issues together. "Image too small? Resize." "Code not working? Check blocks." "How put pic next to text?" Encourage thinking before giving solution. Explain fixing problems = normal part of creating.

    6.  **Save Progress:** Save main project file often.

    7.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What was the trickiest part about putting the pieces together?" "How did we solve \[specific problem\]?"

- **Guided Session 2: Refining the Journey**

  - **LO:** Review assembled draft critically; identify areas for improvement (pacing, clarity, visuals, missing parts); implement refinements (timing, transitions, content); check overall story flow.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Review Together:** Play/click through current project state.

    2.  **Identify Improvements:** Discuss: "Story make sense? Easy to follow?" "Pics on screen long enough?" (Clipchamp/Slides). "Animations smooth?" (Scratch). "Anything missing from outline?" "Title slide exciting?" Make short list of 1-3 things to adjust.

    3.  **Work on Refinements:** Focus on implementing those 1-3 items:

        - *Pacing:* Adjust clip duration (Clipchamp), slide timing/wait blocks (Slides/Scratch).

        - *Transitions:* Add simple 'Fade'/'Slide' (Slides) or code scene changes (Scratch).

        - *Clarity:* Add text caption, re-word story text.

        - *Visuals:* Change background color, adjust image size, add simple decoration.

    4.  **Check Pacing/Flow:** Play adjusted section again. Ask: "Look/feel better?"

    5.  **Save:** Save updated project.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What change did we make that improved the story the most?" "Why is it important to review our work?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Adding Polish"**

  - **Instruction:** "Make project even better! Open main story project file. Choose one small thing from our improvement list, or your own idea. Maybe: Add background color (Scratch)? Change title font (Slides)? Find one more pic (Kiddle first!) for video (Clipchamp)? Make transition smoother?"

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Project refinement, attention to detail, independent problem-solving (minor), using tools for specific adjustments.

  - **Setup:** Access to main project file, list of potential improvements (optional), visual timer.
