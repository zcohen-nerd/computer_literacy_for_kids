# Week 16: Cosmic Creation - Project Planning

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 16 LOs and Activities.

  - Prepare for brainstorming - have materials related to child's interests ready for inspiration.

  - Have Notepad ready for outlining.

  - Be ready to discuss pros/cons of tools (Scratch, Paint 3D, Clipchamp, Tinkercad, Slides) for chosen story.

  - Ensure access to chosen creation tools.

  - Ensure "Space Story Project" (or similarly named) folder exists in "My Projects".

  - Have typing practice site ready.

  - Prepare/print visual instruction card.

  - Set up visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* Allow ample time for brainstorming; don't rush idea selection. Keep the outline very simple (3-5 points). If one tool is clearly preferred, lean into that for asset creation, don't force using too many different tools if it causes frustration.

- **Guided Session 1: Blast Off! Project Planning**

  - **LO:** Define final project goal ("Digital Creation Story"); brainstorm/discuss story ideas based on interests; select one idea; create simple 3-part story outline (Notepad); identify appropriate software tools for components.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Project Goal:** Announce final project! "Next two weeks: use skills learned to create your own Digital Creation Story about \[Child's Interest\]!" (Animation, video, slideshow, interactive story).

    2.  **Brainstorm:** Get excited! Ask open questions related to interests: "What kind of dinosaur adventure? Magical creature quest? Building a super race car?" Use inspiration (pics/books). Write down ideas.

    3.  **Select Idea:** Review list. Discuss which is most fun *and* achievable with learned tools. Choose one concept.

    4.  **Outline:** Open Notepad. Map story together:

        - Type "Beginning:", ask "How start? Character? Setting? Goal?" Type 1-2 sentence summary.

        - Type "Middle:", ask "What next? Journey? Challenges? Discoveries?" Type 2-3 sentence summary.

        - Type "End:", ask "How finish? Goal achieved? What happens?" Type 1-2 sentence summary.  
          Read outline together.

    5.  **Choose Tools:** Look at outline. Discuss: "Tool for drawing characters?" (Paint 3D/Canva). "Tool for animation?" (Scratch). "Tool for showing story with pics/text?" (Slides/Clipchamp). "Tool for designing object?" (Tinkercad). Decide on 1-3 main tools & final format (e.g., "Paint 3D drawings into Clipchamp video with text").

    6.  **Save Outline:** Save Notepad file in project folder (e.g., "My Story Project") as "Story Outline".

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What's the story we decided to tell?" "What tools are we planning to use?"

- **Guided Session 2: Building the Universe - Asset Creation**

  - **LO:** Create dedicated project folder; begin creating initial digital assets (images, code, models) based on plan/tools; practice using tools purposefully; save assets into project folder with descriptive names.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Set Up Project Folder:** If needed, create project folder (e.g., "My Story Project") in "My Projects". Explain organization.

    2.  **Start Creating Assets:** Based on plan, start first pieces:

        - *(Paint 3D -\> Clipchamp plan):* Open Paint 3D. Draw main character. Save as "Main Character.png" in project folder. Draw setting. Save as "Setting Scene.png".

        - *(Scratch plan):* Open Scratch. New project. Choose/draw sprites & backdrop. Code initial action. Save Scratch project online as "My Story Animation".

        - *(Tinkercad -\> Slides plan):* Open Tinkercad. Start designing key object/character. Save Tinkercad project online. (Screenshots later).

    3.  **Focus & Save:** Work on 1-2 key assets. Emphasize saving regularly in project folder with clear names ("Dragon.png", "Castle Design.png").

    4.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What did we create for our story today?" "Why is saving in the project folder important?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Project Work Time"**

  - **Instruction:** "Keep working on our big story project! Open the tool you used last time (Paint 3D, Scratch, Tinkercad) & continue working on a part from our outline. You could: Draw another picture needed; Add more code; Design another part; OR open Notepad & start typing the story words. Save work in the project folder!"

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Using chosen software tools purposefully, contributing to project, saving work, following plan.

  - **Setup:** Access to project files/tools, Story Outline file (optional reference), visual timer.
