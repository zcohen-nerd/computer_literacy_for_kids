# Week 1: Internet Ready - Safety First!

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 1 LOs and Activities.

  - Prepare analogies for explaining the internet (library, city, network of roads).

  - Review the 5 BIA concepts and how to explain them simply.

  - Bookmark [<u>Google Interland: Reality River</u>](https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/interland/reality-river).

  - Prepare materials for "Private vs. Public Info" activity (paper/whiteboard, markers).

  - Ensure Paint 3D (or alternative simple drawing tool) is accessible.

  - Prepare/print the visual instruction card and optional "Help Card" for the independent session (referencing general setup tips below).

  - Set up the visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* Gauge the child's existing awareness of online concepts. If completely new, keep explanations very simple. If they show some understanding, use slightly more specific examples.

- **Guided Session 1: Our Digital World & Being Awesome Online**

  - **LO:** Define the internet simply; understand global connection; introduce "digital citizen"; introduce 5 BIA concepts; emphasize "Talk It Out!".

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Discuss the Internet:** Use analogies (web, city, library). Explain connection, learning, communication, games.

    2.  **Introduce Digital Citizenship:** Explain online responsibility, like being a good citizen offline (respectful, safe).

    3.  **Introduce BIA Concepts:** Explain Smart (Share w/ Care), Alert (No Fakes), Strong (Secrets), Kind (Be Kind), Brave (Talk It Out) simply.

    4.  **Emphasize "Talk It Out":** Stress telling a trusted adult about *anything* confusing or uncomfortable online. This is being brave!

    5.  **Optional Mini-Talk (1â€“2 min):** â€œWe use computers for amazing thingsâ€”but it's important to take breaks too! Our bodies and minds need movement, rest, and time with people we love.â€

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What's one thing the internet lets us do?" "What's the most important rule if something feels weird online?" â€œWhatâ€™s your favorite thing to do *not* on a screen?â€ â€œHow does your body feel after using the computer for a while?â€

- **Guided Session 2: Staying Alert & Protecting Our Secrets**

  - **LO:** Understand online risks (tricks/fakes); identify tricky content examples; distinguish public vs. private info; practice identifying tricks via gameplay.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Discuss "Tricky" Things:** Use examples (fake prizes, quizzes asking private info). Use "tricks" instead of phishing/scam initially.

    2.  **Play Interland - Reality River:** Play Level 1 of [<u>Google Interland: Reality River</u>](https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/interland/reality-river), discussing choices made and why things might be fake.

    3.  **Private vs. Public Info:** Brainstorm list (Okay: favorite color, drawing, first name in supervised context; Secret: full name, birthday, address, phone, school, passwords). Explain *why* secrets are kept safe.

    4.  **Reinforce "Talk It Out":** Remind the child to tell you about tricky messages or requests for secrets.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What makes some information 'secret' online?" "What did the game teach you about spotting fakes?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Safety Explorer"**

  - **Instruction:** "Practice our safety rules! Either: 1) Open Paint 3D & draw a picture showing a safety rule (like 'Be Kind' or 'Talk to a Grown-Up'). OR 2) Play Reality River on Interland again & try to beat your score!"

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Recalling safety concepts, digital art OR game practice, mouse control.

  - **Setup:** Visual timer, Paint 3D access, link to Interland, visual instruction card.
