# Week 8: Entering the 3D Zone - Tinkercad Time!

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 8 LOs and Activities.

  - Ensure [<u>Tinkercad</u>](https://www.tinkercad.com/) account is set up and login works.

  - Refresh understanding of Tinkercad interface, adding/moving shapes, view controls (orbit/pan/zoom).

  - Refresh understanding of resizing, lifting, aligning, grouping, and Hole tool.

  - Have typing practice site ready.

  - Prepare/print visual instruction card & optional Tinkercad shapes reference.

  - Set up visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* If 3D navigation is tricky, spend more time just practicing orbit/pan/zoom. If shape manipulation is easy, try building a slightly more complex object combining multiple groups or holes.

  - *Final Project Link:* "We're learning Tinkercad now! This tool lets us build 3D shapes. You could use this to design a cool spaceship, a base on another planet, or maybe even a character for your final 'Digital Creation Story' project!"

- **Guided Session 1: Thinking in 3D**

  - **LO:** Distinguish 2D vs. 3D; understand Workplane concept; navigate Tinkercad interface (add shapes, move shapes, use view controls).

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **2D vs. 3D:** Show Paint 3D drawing vs. [<u>Tinkercad</u>](https://www.tinkercad.com/) interface. Explain Tinkercad = building solid-looking things from all sides.

    2.  **Tinkercad Interface:** Log in. Point out Workplane (blue grid = building table), Basic Shapes menu (right = building blocks).

    3.  **Add Shapes:** Drag Box, Cylinder, Sphere onto Workplane.

    4.  **Move Shapes:** Click shape to select. Click & drag selected shape (not handles) to move on Workplane. Practice placing shapes.

    5.  **View Controls Practice:** Spend time practicing:

        - Orbit: Right-click & drag mouse to rotate view. Look from all sides.

        - Zoom: Mouse scroll wheel (or +/- buttons).

        - Pan: Press/hold scroll wheel (or Shift + Right-click) & drag to slide view.

        - View Cube: Click faces (Top, Front) & Home icon.

    6.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "How is Tinkercad different from Paint 3D?" "Which view control helps you see the top of your object?"

- **Guided Session 2: Shaping Up in Tinkercad**

  - **LO:** Resize shapes (handles); lift/lower shapes (cone handle); select multiple shapes; align shapes (Align tool); group shapes (Group tool); use Hole tool; combine shapes/holes.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Resize Shapes:** Select Box. Drag white corner handles (proportional), black side handles (stretch/squash). Note dimension numbers.

    2.  **Lift/Lower:** Select shape. Drag black cone handle above shape up/down.

    3.  **Select Multiple:** Show drag-box selection and Shift+Click selection.

    4.  **Align Tool:** Select 2 shapes. Click 'Align' button. Hover over dots to preview, click dot to align (e.g., center).

    5.  **Group Tool:** Overlap 2 shapes. Select both. Click 'Group'. Observe they become one object/color. Show 'Ungroup'. Practice.

    6.  **Hole Tool:** Drag new shape (e.g., Cylinder). Select it. Click 'Hole' option in Inspector window (becomes translucent grey).

    7.  **Combine Shapes & Holes:** Overlap Hole Cylinder with solid Box. Select both. Click 'Group'. Observe subtraction. Ungroup to show originals.

    8.  **Build Simple Object:** Try building basic house (cube + roof, maybe hole window) or simple car (cubes + cylinder wheels), or a simple character.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What does the 'Group' tool do?" "How do you make a hole in an object?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Shape Builder"**

  - **Instruction:** "Time to build in 3D! Go into [<u>Tinkercad</u>](https://www.tinkercad.com/). Try building something cool using at least three *different* kinds of shapes from the menu (like a Box, a Sphere, and maybe a Cone or a Roof). It could be a weird alien, a spaceship part, a fantasy castle, or anything you imagine! See if you can group some shapes together to make a single object."

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Tinkercad navigation, adding shapes, moving/resizing/lifting shapes, grouping (optional).

  - **Setup:** Tinkercad access (requires free account), visual timer, visual reference of basic shapes (optional).
