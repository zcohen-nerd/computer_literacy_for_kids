# Week 14: Movie Maker Moments - Video Ventures

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 14 LOs and Activities.

  - Ensure [<u>Microsoft Clipchamp</u>](https://app.clipchamp.com/) accessible (built-in app or web; may need free Microsoft account). Familiarize with import, timeline, text tool, stock audio, export.

  - Ensure images available for importing (Paint 3D drawings, saved pictures).

  - Have typing practice site ready.

  - Prepare/print visual instruction card.

  - Set up visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* If Clipchamp seems complex, focus just on sequencing images and adding music. If the child is enjoying it, explore simple video effects or transitions between clips.

  - *Final Project Link:* "Making videos like this is another great way you could choose to tell your final 'Digital Creation Story'!"

  - *Storytelling Prompt:* Encourage arranging the imported images in an order that makes logical or narrative sense, like steps in a process or scenes in a story.

- **Guided Session 1: Lights, Camera, Clipchamp!**

    5.  **Preview & Adjust Duration:** Click 'Play' below preview. Note default duration. Hover over clip end on timeline -\> cursor changes -\> click & drag to change duration (aim 3-5 sec).

    6.  **Reorder Clips:** Click & drag whole clip on timeline to change position.

    7.  **Save Project:** Show how to name project (top of screen). Explain auto-save (web).

    8.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What does the timeline show us?" "How do you change how long a picture stays on screen?"

- **Guided Session 2: Sound & Style**

  - **LO:** Add simple text overlays; adjust basic text appearance; adjust text duration; add background music from library; adjust audio volume; export finished video file (MP4).

    7.  **View Exported File:** Save exported MP4 file (to 'My Projects' or 'Downloads'). Play file using computer's media player. Show final result.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "How did we add words to the video?" "Why did we turn the music volume down a bit?" "What does 'Export' do?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Picture Movie"**

  - **Instruction:** "Make tiny movie! Start new video in [<u>Clipchamp</u>](https://app.clipchamp.com/). Find 3-4 saved pictures (drawings/photos). Import them. Drag to timeline in order telling tiny story (e.g., character wakes up, eats breakfast, goes outside). Try making each picture show for 3-4 seconds."

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Basic video editing (importing, sequencing, adjusting duration).

  - **Setup:** Clipchamp access, folder with saved images, visual timer.
