# Week 4: Internet Island & Search Skills

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 4 LOs and Activities.

  - Ensure browser works, safe search enabled if possible.

  - Bookmark [<u>Kiddle</u>](https://www.kiddle.co/), [<u>NASA Kids' Club</u>](https://www.nasa.gov/kidsclub/), [<u>Nat Geo Kids</u>](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/) (or other relevant kid-safe sites based on interest).

  - Prepare discussion points on website trustworthiness (known source, looks professional/kid-friendly vs cluttered/ad-heavy).

  - Set up typing practice site ([<u>TypingClub</u>](https://www.typingclub.com/) / [<u>BBC Dance Mat</u>](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zf2f9j6/articles/z3c6tfr)).

  - Prepare/print visual instruction card.

  - Set up visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* If searching is easy, try slightly more complex search terms (e.g., "what did stegosaurus eat"). If comparing sites is hard, focus just on identifying known sources vs. unknown ones.

  - *Final Project Link:* "We're learning how to find information online. Later, when we do our big 'Digital Creation Story' project, you might need to look up facts about your chosen topic, so this skill will be super helpful!"

- **Guided Session 1: Web Browser Voyage & Safe Sites**

  - **LO:** Use browser (address bar, back/forward, refresh); navigate safe sites; use kid-friendly search engine ([<u>Kiddle</u>](https://www.kiddle.co/)); perform simple keyword searches; begin typing practice.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Browser Tour:** Open browser. Point out address bar, back/forward, refresh. Explain functions.

    2.  **Visit Safe Sites:** Visit pre-selected safe sites relevant to interests (e.g., [<u>NASA Kids' Club</u>](https://www.nasa.gov/kidsclub/), [<u>Nat Geo Kids</u>](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/), museum kids' pages). Discuss why they are safe/good (trusted names, educational).

    3.  **Introduce Kiddle:** Go to [<u>Kiddle</u>](https://www.kiddle.co/). Explain it's a safer search engine for kids.

    4.  **Practice Searching:** Help pick keywords for interests (e.g., "T-Rex facts," "how rockets work," "pictures of puppies"). Type into Kiddle. Look at image/web results.

    5.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Start first lesson on [<u>TypingClub</u>](https://www.typingclub.com/) or [<u>BBC Dance Mat</u>](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zf2f9j6/articles/z3c6tfr). Focus on posture, home row.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What does the address bar show?" "Why might we use Kiddle instead of a regular search engine sometimes?"

- **Guided Session 2: Thinking About Search Results**

  - **LO:** Understand search results link to different sites; identify simple trustworthiness clues (known source, appearance); compare info from two sources; reinforce asking adult if unsure.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Review Search:** Perform search on [<u>Kiddle</u>](https://www.kiddle.co/) (e.g., "how fast can cheetah run?"). Explain each link = different website.

    2.  **Evaluate Links (Simple):** Look at top results. Ask: "Know this website name?" (e.g., Nat Geo Kids vs. random name). "Description helpful?" Click 1-2 links. Ask: "Easy to read? For kids or grown-ups? Lots of ads?"

    3.  **Compare Information:** Find simple fact (e.g., cheetah speed, number of legs on insect) on two different kid-friendly sites via Kiddle. Ask: "Do they match?" Discuss reliability.

    4.  **Reinforce "Talk It Out":** Remind: "If website looks strange, confusing, asks for info, what do you do?" (Tell a grown-up!).

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "How can you guess if a website might be good before clicking?" "Why look at more than one website?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Fact Collector"**

  - **Instruction:** "Be an info detective! Use [<u>Kiddle</u>](https://www.kiddle.co/) to find one interesting fact about a topic you like (e.g., dinosaurs, planets, a favorite animal). Write the fact (or draw a picture about it) in Notepad/Paint 3D or just be ready to tell me."

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Using kid-safe search engine, formulating queries, extracting information.

  - **Setup:** Visual instruction card with Kiddle link, Notepad/Paint 3D (optional), visual timer.
