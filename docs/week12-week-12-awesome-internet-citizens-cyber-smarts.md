# Week 12: Awesome Internet Citizens & Cyber Smarts

- **Teacher Preparation (Before the Week's Sessions):**

  - Review Week 12 LOs and Activities, focusing on BIA pillars (Kind, Care, Strong).

  - Bookmark/have ready: [<u>Kind Kingdom</u>](https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/interland/kind-kingdom), [<u>Mindful Mountain</u>](https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/interland/mindful-mountain), [<u>Tower of Treasure</u>](https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/interland/tower-of-treasure).

  - Prepare simple role-playing scenarios for kindness/unkindness.

  - Prepare strong password brainstorming examples (phrase-based, mixes - NOT real ones).

  - Have Paint 3D or Canva ready for independent session.

  - Have typing practice site ready.

  - Prepare/print visual instruction card.

  - Set up visual timer.

  - *Flexibility Note:* Spend more time on the Interland game the child enjoys most or the concept they need more reinforcement on (Kindness, Sharing, Passwords). Keep role-playing simple and focused on positive actions.

- **Guided Session 1: Be Internet Awesome - Kind & Careful!**

  - **LO:** Define/discuss online kindness ("It's Cool to Be Kind"); positive vs. negative behavior; appropriate actions for unkindness (Tell adult, block); think before sharing ("Share with Care"); review private/public info; simple digital footprint concept.

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Discuss Kindness:** Ask: "How be kind online?" (Nice words, help). Discuss why unkindness hurts. Use BIA slogan: "It's Cool to Be Kind."

    2.  **Play Kind Kingdom:** Play [**<u>Google Interland: Kind Kingdom</u>**](https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/interland/kind-kingdom). Discuss scenarios (spread kindness, block negativity).

    3.  **Role-Play:** Scenario: "Mean comment on your drawing?" Discuss options: Don't reply meanly, tell adult, block (explain simply). Emphasize telling adult.

    4.  **Share with Care Review:** Review private vs. public info (Week 1). Ask: "Why keep address secret?" Use BIA slogan "Share with Care." Explain: "Think who you share with."

    5.  **Digital Footprint Intro:** Explain simply: "Online actions leave 'footprints'. They can last long time. Leave kind & careful footprints!"

    6.  **Play Mindful Mountain:** Play [**<u>Google Interland: Mindful Mountain</u>**](https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/interland/mindful-mountain). Discuss sharing info only with right people.

    7.  **Typing Practice (5-10 min):** Continue typing lessons.

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What's one way to be kind online?" "What does 'Share with Care' mean?"

- **Guided Session 2: Be Internet Awesome - Strong & Secure!**

  - **LO:** Explain password importance ("Secure Your Secrets"); identify stronger password traits (length, mix); brainstorm memorable strong password *ideas*; understand the role of two-factor authentication (2FA); recognize online tricks (phishing).

  - **Activity:**

    1.  **Why Passwords?:** Ask: "What needs password?" (Email, games). Explain passwords = secret keys. Use BIA slogan: "Secure Your Secrets."

    2.  **Strong Password Ideas:** Review why easy passwords bad. Brainstorm stronger ideas:

        - Phrase: "My green dino loves leaves!" -\> MgdL0v3sL3@ves!

        - Combine: "Robot+Castle+8" -\> R0b0tC@stle8!

        - Length: Longer = better.  
          CRITICAL: Stress ideas only. Never use examples or real passwords. Create real ones privately, never share.

    3.  What is 2FA?: Explain that some accounts need two things to unlockâ€”this is called Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). It's like opening a treasure chest that needs both a key (your password) and a secret code (sent to your phone or email). It makes your account even safer.

        - Analogy: "A treasure chest with two locks is harder for a pirate to break into!"

        - Ask: "Why does using two steps make it harder for someone else to log into your stuff?"

        - Reinforce: If you ever see a screen asking for a second step or a code, always talk to a grown-up first.

    4.  **Play Tower of Treasure:** Play [**<u>Google Interland: Tower of Treasure</u>**](https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/interland/tower-of-treasure). Discuss *why* game suggests changes (length, numbers, symbols).

    5.  **Spotting Tricks (Phishing Review):** Show simple fake examples (Notepad): "Account locked! Click here enter password." or "You won! Enter name/address." Ask: "Look real? Why/why not? What do?"

    6.  **Reinforce "Talk It Out":** Ask: "What if site asks password unexpectedly, or friend asks?" (Never share, tell grown-up!).

  - **Reflection (1-2 min):** Ask: "What makes a password stronger?" "What should you do if a message asks for your password?" "Why might a website ask for two things to log in?"

- **Independent Session (20 min): "Safety Poster"**

  - **Instruction:** "Make reminder poster! Open Paint 3D or [<u>Canva</u>](https://www.canva.com/). Create poster showing one 'Be Internet Awesome' rule (Be Kind, Be Careful, Be Strong)."

  - **Skills Reinforced:** Digital art (Paint 3D/Canva), recalling/representing BIA safety concepts.

  - **Setup:** Paint 3D/Canva access (Canva requires free account), visual instruction card, visual timer.
