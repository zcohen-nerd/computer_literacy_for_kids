# 18-Week Computer Literacy Curriculum for Young Learners (Age ~7)

## Overview

Welcome! This repository contains a detailed 18-week curriculum designed to introduce young learners (around age 7) to foundational computer literacy and digital citizenship skills. Developed with beginners in mind, it assumes basic reading ability and requires active adult guidance (parent, educator, or mentor).

The curriculum aims to build confidence and competence in using computers (specifically Windows 11, though adaptable), navigating the internet safely, and exploring digital creativity tools. It balances guided instruction with opportunities for independent, creative practice.

**Structure:** 18 Weeks | 2 x 30-min Guided Sessions/Week | 1 x 20-min Independent Session/Week
